<h3>Features of HTML and CSS that I discovered</h3> <!-- Reflection -->
<div class="content"> <!-- Section for CSS features, build using flex-wrap:wrap to make it look like a table -->

    <div class="first"> <!-- First box containing the description of "Flex-direction" feature -->
        <h2>Flex-direction</h2>
        <p>"Flex-direction" is a type of 'display:flex" that helps to organize the website to make it more presentable. 
            For this project, I used "flex-direction: row", that aligns elements in a row. This feature is usually used for navigation of a website,
            to make sure that the user can find it at the top of a website. I also used this element to put information about my ptojects next to each other,
            so it's easier to find it. In this way, the user can see both the presentation/report and see the code.</p>
    </div>


    <div class="second"> <!-- Second box containing a picture representing the "Flex-direction" element -->
        <h2>Example</h2>
        <img src="flex-direction.avif" width="350" height="350">
    </div>


    <div class="third"> <!-- Third box containing the description of "Flex-wrap" feature -->
        <h2>Flex-wrap</h2>
        <p>"Flex-wrap" is another type of "flex-direction". It's written as "flex-wrap:wrap" and unlike "flex-direction:row", 
            it puts elements in a few lines. The creator of the website can adjust the number of lines and elements in one row 
            by adjusting the size of each box. I only used flex wrap on my reflection page to show different elements of my website that I used.
            This structure makes it easier for user to compare 2 features and allows to see pictures of how to use them.</p>
